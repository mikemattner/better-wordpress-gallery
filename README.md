Better WordPress Gallery
========================

This plugin uses more semantic markup for the gallery shortcode output. Use your gallery shortcode as you normally would. I recommend modifying the included CSS to fit your theme's layout, but these base styles should make a responsive approach pretty simple.

Options
-------

Some basic options have been added and can be checked on the settings page, Settings>Better Gallery Settings, and include:

* The option to include the plugin CSS
* The option show, or remove captions permanently (by request)
* The option to set the attribute file="link" as the default link option
